# TO-DO LIST APP

This README provides an overview and explanation of the code snippet you provided. It demonstrates a basic web application example that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MongoDB as the database.

# Prerequisites

MongoDB: A NoSQL database system
A web server or framework capable of handling HTTP requests (e.g., Express.js for Node.js)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

                npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

                npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

               npm run build

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Explanation

The provided code is written in HTML and uses a templating language to dynamically generate the web page content. Here's an explanation of the different parts:

### HTML Structure

The code begins with the standard HTML structure. It defines the document type, the HTML language, and includes the necessary metadata in the <head> section.

The <body> section contains the main content of the page.

### Page Title and Heading
  
The element displays the title of the page, which is "Mongodb CRUD Example".

### Create Operation
  
The code checks if the name variable is present. If it is, the page displays an edit form. Otherwise, it displays a create form.

### Edit Form
  
If the name variable is present, the code displays an edit form. The form's add task attribute specifies the endpoint to handle the form submission for updating a book with the given name.

### Create Form
  
If the name variable is not present, the code displays a create form. The form's add task attribute specifies the endpoint to handle the form submission for creating a new task.
  
 # Conclusion
  
  This code snippet demonstrates a basic web application that allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a collection of online shopping stored in a MongoDB database. It provides forms for creating new things and editing existing ones, as well as displaying a list of books with options to edit or delete each things.
